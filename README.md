# Unit-1-Homework-Assignment-FinTech-Case-Study


## Overview and Origin

* The name of the company for this Case Study is Riskified.

* Riskified was founded on September 2012 in Tel Aviv, Israel. 

* The founders of the company are Eido Gal and Assaf Feldman.

* The idea for the company came about when the founders discovered that “eCommerce wasn’t reaching its potential. Shopping had changed dramatically, and legacy systems couldn’t keep up.”

* Riskified secured $63.7 million in funding. In November 2019, the organization announced that it would obtain a round of funding through a Series E funding of $165 million from General Atlantic, Fidelity Management & Research, Winslow Capital, and its original investors.


## Business Activities:

* The specific financial problem that Riskified was trying to initially solve was to provide fraud solutions, “helping merchants approve orders they would have declined.” The problem today has since evolved to include customer account protection, help with increasing bank-authorization rates, and to offer shoppers alternate payment methods. This is in addition to their original fraud prevention solutions.

* The company’s intended customers are retailers who have an online presence. Some of their main customer include retailers like Macy’s and Finish Line. 

According to Statista and Grand View Research, the fraud detection and prevention (FDP) market size was valued at “20.98 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.4% from 2021 to 2028.” Currently, as of 2021, the market size is valued at “23.0 billion USD and the revenue forecast in 2028 is projection to exceed 62 billion U.S. dollars.”

The solution that Riskified offers their customer, which their competitors do not offer, is the use of AI-powered software as a service (SaaS) fraud and chargeback prevention technology which enable merchants to recognize fraudulent customers.

* According to ProgrammableWeb, Riskified’s technology uses behavioral analysis, elastic linking, proxy detection, and machine learning to detect and prevent fraud.


## Landscape:

* Riskified is within the Payments Domain of the financial industry; specifically, within the sub-domain of payment back-end infrastructure.

* Some of the major trends and innovations of the Payment domain over the last 5-10 years has been the advent of online banking and services, such as Google and Apple Pay, as well as, the increased trend of online shopping, especially in the last two years. Retailers are also making it more convenient to shop online through apps on a mobile phone. Accelerated shipping services have also made the online shopping experience more convenient. And, consumers today are just a swipe or click away from accessing their personal funds, making transactions more convenient and a highly intuitive experience.

* The other major companies in this domain are Signifyd, Forter, CyberSource(which Visa bought in 2010), and Accertify (which was acquired by American Express also in 2010).


## Results

* The business impact of Riskified so far has been its ability to capture sales for their customers that would’ve otherwise been lost (along with the lost merchandise due to chargebacks) had the transaction been flagged as fraudulent. Moreover, there are fewer phone calls during the purchasing phase to verify the legitimacy of a transaction.

* Some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success are total online volume, approval rate, total approved volume, chargeback %, and total costs. Based on these metrics, Riskified boasts a 94.68% approval rate versus the 85% approval rate without Riskified. Total approved volume with Riskified is $132,552,000 and without would be $119,000,000. Lastly, of the 1.63% in chargebacks, there are total costs $629,622 with Riskified versus $1,939,700 if an online retail does not have Riskified’s services. These costs include lost merchandise from chargebacks. As seen in the data, Riskified is adding value to retailers based on these metrics.

* Relative to competitors in the same domain Riskified is competitive. Their AI machine learning algorithms give them a competitive advantage within this space, however, as more and more firms catch up technologically, they margins will tighten and this space will become even more competitive.


## Recommendations

* If I were to advise Riskified, I would suggest they work with their retail customers to develop the infrastructure to transact via a tokenized method of payment such as any one of the stable coins that are currently within the marketplace. 
 
* Offering an infrastructure to transact via a tokenized payment method across the blockchain could aid in the fight against fraud, which so many retailers battle year after year. Moreover, merchandise could also be tracked via some form of ledger (such as a digital contract) so that when a transaction occurs, the intent of the purchase is traced to its purchaser. 

* The technologies that this additional product/service would utilize is blockchain technology, as well as, cryptographic currency.

* Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are an appropriate solution to the battle against fraud, specifically chargebacks, because end customers would no longer be able to buy merchandise, dispute the transaction with their banks, receive a refund along with the merchandise. By removing banking and credit card institutions from the transaction, merchandisers and end-customers would be able to transact without any intermediaries, and, hence, resolve any transaction issues directly.
